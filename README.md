# Requirements

The `php_apc_` plugin is made for the Munin v1.4.0+ monitoring system.

The Munin homepage can be found at: http://munin-monitoring.org/


# Documentation

Project homepage:  http://code.google.com/p/munin-php-apc/


# Installation and Usage

Copy the file apc_info.php to a location accessible to the web server, such as:

    www.example.com/apc_info.php
  
Add the following lines to the munin-node file, usually found in
`/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node`.

    [php_apc_*]
    user root
    env.url http://www.example.com/apc_info.php?auto

There are 10 available graphs for this multi graph plugin:

  - `php_apc_files`
  - `php_apc_fragmentation`
  - `php_apc_hit_miss`
  - `php_apc_purge`
  - `php_apc_rates`
  - `php_apc_usage`
  - `php_apc_mem_size`
  - `php_apc_user_hit_miss`
  - `php_apc_user_entries`
  - `php_apc_user_rates`

Each required graph should be added to the plugins directory, usually found in
`/etc/munin/plugins/`.

The common approach is to copy the file `apc_php_` to the directory `/usr/share/munin/plugins/`
and then add a symbolic link to it from `/etc/munin/plugins/`.

For example:

    sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_files
    sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/php_apc_ /etc/munin/plugins/php_apc_fragmentation
    ..

After symlinking the files, restart munin-node (`$ sudo service munin-node restart`).

For more information regarding installation of Munin plugins, read the
[Munin documentation][1].
